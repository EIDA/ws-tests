# ws-tests
## To Do list
* ETH: upload tests presented in the ETC Meeting (Athens, May 2017).
* all nodes: copy/paste the tests with own parameter values.
* all nodes: use issue tracker to discuss the improvement of the tests or to suggest new ones.

## Short description

This repository contains a set of tests mainly designed to evaluate the performance or availability of the different EIDA web services.

Some of the services to include in the tests are:

* Dataselect
* Station-WS
* WFCatalog
* Routing Service
* Federator

The first draft set of tests have been presented by Philip and Fabian in the ETC Meeting in Athens (May 2017). After these tests are uploaded **all nodes must use them as templates in order to modify the parameter values and generate their owns**.

The issue tracker can be used to suggest improvements to the test and/or to discuss about the feasibility/convenience of using them.
